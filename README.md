# Getting Started

This repository is meant to provide Handwriting Recognition resources and examples. It also contains on-boarding instructions for new
members joining the team. There are also a number of Colab notebooks designed to introduce you to Handwriting Recognition concepts and
TensorFlow.

Documentation:
* [Setup Instructions](https://github.com/BYU-Handwriting-Lab/GettingStarted/blob/master/documentation/Setup.md)
* [Learning Resources](https://github.com/BYU-Handwriting-Lab/GettingStarted/blob/master/documentation/Learning.md)

Colab Notebooks
* [Hello World (TensorFlow)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/BYU-Handwriting-Lab/GettingStarted/blob/master/notebooks/HelloWorldTensorFlow.ipynb)
  * This notebook is designed to help you test out your skills with TensorFlow. The MNIST dataset is provided for you. Your job is to load the data,
    build the model, and write the training loop. A solution is also provided on the [*solution*](https://colab.research.google.com/github/BYU-Handwriting-Lab/GettingStarted/blob/solution/notebooks/HelloWorldTensorFlow.ipynb) branch for your reference in case you get stuck.
* [Baseline Detection & Segmentation (TensorFlow)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/BYU-Handwriting-Lab/GettingStarted/blob/master/notebooks/ARUNetSegmentation.ipynb)
* [Handwriting Recognition (Pytorch)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/BYU-Handwriting-Lab/GettingStarted/blob/master/notebooks/handwriting-recognition-pytorch.ipynb)
* [Handwriting Recognition (TensorFlow)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/BYU-Handwriting-Lab/GettingStarted/blob/master/notebooks/handwriting-recognition-tensorflow.ipynb)
