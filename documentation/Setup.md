### GitHub

* If you don't have access already, email Dr. Clement or someone from the lab to give you full access to the BYU Handwriting Lab
  GitHub organization. This will allow you to read/write public and private repositories.
* Feel free to check out the [learning resources](https://github.com/BYU-Handwriting-Lab/GettingStarted/blob/master/documentation/Learning.md)
  available to you in this repository including links to help guides and interactive
  [Colab Notebooks](https://github.com/BYU-Handwriting-Lab/GettingStarted/tree/master/notebooks).

### Slack

### Supercomputer

* Request an account on the supercomputer [here](https://rc.byu.edu/account/create/)
    * You'll need information to the following questions:
        * What research are you doing?
            * Handwriting recognition and other machine learning techniques to automate the process of indexing.
	          This requires training deep learning models with large datasets that requires large amounts of
	          processing power.
	    *   What software will you use?
            * Machine learning models are written in Python and TensorFlow
	        * Anaconda is used as a package manager to maintain program dependencies
	    *   What resources do you anticipate needing?
            * Memory: 256GB
	        * Disk: 1TB
	        * GPUs: 4
	        * Run-Time: 24 Hours
* Email Dr. Clement to join the fslg_handwriting shared group. Many of our datasets and models are saved in these shared directories.
* Copy the .bashrc file into your home directory

### Email Group

* Email Dr. Clement to join the Family History Lab email group and Handwriting Team email group

### Undergraduates

* If you're an undergraduate, make sure you've filled out a [mentoring application](https://mentoring.byu.edu/)
